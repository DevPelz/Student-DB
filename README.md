# Building a Decentralized Student Database with Ethereum Smart Contracts

This smart contract demonstrates the benefits of decentralization in the educational domain. By storing student information on the Ethereum blockchain, we ensure that the data is tamper-proof, transparent, and accessible only to authorized individuals. Additionally, the need for intermediaries to manage student records is eliminated, reducing administrative overhead and enhancing security.
